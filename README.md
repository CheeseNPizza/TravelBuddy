# TravelBuddy Mobile App

Our proposed idea is to develop a social media mobile application that aims to provide a platform for travelers to connect with like-minded people all around the world. 
This application will provide a platform for travelers to make friends, share experiences or stories in a journey, 
collect information to plan their journey and learn about the culture of various places.
